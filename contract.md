### API Contracts & JSON
* API contracts are a popular means for API providers and consumers 
* to agree upon how an API will behave.
* API contracts can be as simple as shared documentation to sophisticated contract management and validation frameworks.
* Combined with JSON contracts can be a powerful means to help API providers and consumers develop and test APIs.

### Testing First The Red, Green, Refactor Loop
* Write a failing test
* Use TDD to test a JSON data contract
* Use TDD to test JSON deserialization

* Red: Write a failing test for the desired functionality.
* Green: Implement the simplest thing that can work to make the test pass.
* Refactor: Look for opportunities to simplify, reduce duplication, or otherwise improve the code without changing any behaviorâ€”to refactor.
* Repeat!
